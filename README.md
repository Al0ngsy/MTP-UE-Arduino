Requirement:

[Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) is required to checkout the project.

Project created with Unreal Engine version 5.3.2. Other (minor) version (of version 5) might be able to oben the project as well, UE should be able to update the project by itself.

Project requires a free plugin in the Unreal Marketplace ([Read &amp; write text file](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/read-write-text-file)) to oben.

To test play on and build the project for HMD, additinal steps might be needed depending on the type of HMD. Take a look at the documentation of UE ([link](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.3/en-US/supported-xr-devices-in-unreal-engine/)) to know which HMD is suppoted and additional step needed to make it runs with Unreal Engine.
